# background_generator

## generate pretty desktop background with 2D gray codes

### fun facts about the images:
- each colour (i.e. (r, g, b) triple) appears exactly once in each image (yes, in every single one!)
- each pixel differs from its four neighbours by exactly one bit (the Gray property)

### requirements and configuration
this is for Linux. you need `feh` installed.

configure the file in `$HOME/.config/ggbackground.conf
